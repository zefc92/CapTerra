CapTerra is a small business with a green thumb and a big heart. Our team is led by Jozef Cap, who recently completed a diploma degree in Horticulture Technology at Olds College in Olds, Alberta. 

Joe is a lifelong Alberta resident, and he has done both professional and private landscape design for several years. He is eager to apply his experience and technical knowledge to planting and design projects of every size. Aside from satisfying his customers, Joe hopes his work will make Calgaryâ€™s urban landscape even more beautiful and sustainable.
