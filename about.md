## About Us

<z span class= "image right"><img src="{{"/images/excavator.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" ></z>
CapTerra is a small business with a green thumb and a big heart. Our team is led by Jozef Cap, who recently completed a diploma in Horticulture Technology at Olds College in Olds, Alberta. Before studying Horticulture, Joe had a career in the Engineering Drafting and Design field right here in Calgary.
Joe has found success in combining his professional experience and technical education in the Calgary residential landscaping market and is eager to apply his knowledge to new planting and design projects of every size. Aside from satisfying his customers, Joe hopes his work will make Calgaryâ€™s urban landscape even more beautiful and sustainable.
